## General information

This WebApp is an application based on the API ["The movie database"](https://www.themoviedb.org/) (TMDB). It offers access from the home page to the new movies of the week and to movies by genre. A "suggerator", a movie suggestion interface proposes a filter based on the mood, the state of tiredness and the interest of the spectator (which translates into a filter on the duration of the movie, its style and its release date). 

### Project status and progress

This project is a Front project. It was developed by 6 developers in training at the Wild Code School of Lille (React Javascript) as a half training project (Project 2). 
## Technologies

### Template

- Template` : Application developed on React, Node Express from a [template](https://github.com/WildCodeSchool/js-template-fullstack) developed by the Wild Code School. Only the frontend was used. 

**Tools used in this template:**

- _Concurrently_ : Allows to execute several commands in the same terminal
- _Husky_ : Allows to execute actions when triggered by _git_ commands
- _Vite_ : Alternative to _Create-React-App_, with fewer packages for a smoother experience
- _ESLint_ : "Code quality" tool, ensures that pre-configured rules are respected
- _Prettier_ : "code quality" tool also, focuses more specifically on code style
- _Standard Airbnb_ : One of the most well known "standards", even if it is not officially linked to ES/JS
- _Nodemon_ : Tool to restart a server each time one of the files is modified

### Libraries used

  - Styled Component was used to manage the style of the application.
  - React Router to manage the links between pages.
  - Swiper to manage the welcome carousel on the application.
  - Prop-types to type the props.
  - Axios for API calls.

## Installation

    setup : Initialization of the frontend and backend as well as the tools
    dev : Start the three servers (frontend in the same terminal)
    dev-front : Start a React server for the frontend
    lint: Run code validation tools (will be run automatically at each commit)
